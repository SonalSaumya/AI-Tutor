AI-Powered Tutor using LLMs and RAG
This project is an open-source AI tutor that helps students learn by generating personalized exercises, questions, and explanations. It uses Large Language Models (LLMs) and a technique called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate and context-aware educational content, all without the need for any paid APIs.

What It Does
The system takes PDF files â€” such as textbooks, lecture notes, or research papers and:
Extracts meaningful content using text processing tools
Retrieves relevant information related to a topic or query
Generates personalized questions and answers
Provides clear explanations based on the content in the uploaded PDF
Whether you're a student preparing for exams, a teacher creating study material, or a self-learner, this AI tutor adapts to your needs by working directly with your study resources.

How It Works
The project combines two powerful techniques:
LLMs (Large Language Models): Used for natural language understanding and response generation
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Enhances the LLM's output by grounding it in specific content from the uploaded document
Together, they ensure that the generated questions and answers are not only grammatically correct but also factually relevant to the input material.
